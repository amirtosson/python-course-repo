I used two different ways for doing the caclulations.

The User will basically see the same stuff in both codes, the diferences are in the codes.

The differences are found in the Basic and the Advanced classes, the Scientific class is basically the same (I had no interest in changing!) 

Unlike Method1, In Method2 code (because I like it more) I managed the errors that the user can input.

There is also a major difference in the output of the Advanced class; I did not understand which is required from the following:
take this example: (1+2*3)
1. Should I calculate the entire expression at once? If you enter  this expression in Python at once, it will evaluate the multiplication first, final result = 7
2. Or Should I calculate step by step?:
   add 1+2 
   then mutiply the result by 3
   the final result = 9
Because I did not know what exactly is required, I did both!
In Method1 Code I calculate step by step, Whereas in Method2 Code I calculate the entire expression at once. But in both, the user enter the same stuff.
