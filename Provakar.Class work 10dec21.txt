Task-1: Learn 3 new methods for strings in Python
Method 1 
casefold() - Converts string into lower case

Example: 
txt = "HELLO, FRIENDS!"

x = txt.casefold()

print(x)

Method 2
Make the lower case letters upper case and the upper case letters lower case: swapcase()

Example: 
txt = "Hello My Name Is Provakar"

x = txt.swapcase()

print(x)



Method -3
Split a string into a list where each word is a list item:
Example- 

txt = "Welcome to the Python class"

x = txt.split()

print(x)



Task 2:
Write a code to print sum of the first and the last elements in my_list
my_list = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]


Soln :
my_list = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
x = my_list[0]
y = my_list [-1]
z = x + y
print (z)


Task 3: Write a code to convert 6th element in my_list into a string, without affecting the original list

Soln: 
my_list = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
x = str(my_list [6])
print (x)
print (type(x))
